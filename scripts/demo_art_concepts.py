SAMPLE_CONCEPTS = {
    "Impressionism": """A sun-drenched garden scene bathed in dappled light filtering through leafy trees, 
captured in loose, visible brushstrokes that emphasize the play of natural light and color. The composition 
features a winding gravel path bordered by beds of vibrant poppies, irises, and wild roses in shades of 
scarlet, violet, and soft pink. The brushwork is quick and spontaneous, with colors applied in short, broken 
strokes that blend optically rather than on the palette. Shadows are rendered in complementary purples and 
blues rather than black, creating a luminous quality. The atmospheric perspective softens distant elements, 
with trees dissolving into hazy, shimmering forms. The overall effect captures a fleeting moment of light 
and atmosphere, with emphasis on the sensory impression rather than precise detail, embodying the 
Impressionist focus on capturing the ephemeral nature of light and color in outdoor settings.""",
    
    "Cubism": """A fragmented still life composition presenting a guitar, wine bottle, and newspaper simultaneously 
from multiple viewpoints, deconstructed into geometric planes and facets. The objects are broken down into 
overlapping angular shapes—triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids—rendered in a muted palette of ochres, grays, 
and earth tones with accents of deep umber. The perspective is intentionally flattened, collapsing three-dimensional 
space onto a two-dimensional plane. Collage elements include actual newsprint fragments and simulated wood grain 
textures. The composition employs analytical fragmentation where recognizable elements—the guitar's sound hole, 
bottle's silhouette, text fragments—emerge from the geometric abstraction. Hard edges and sharp angles dominate, 
with a grid-like underlying structure organizing the fractured forms. The monochromatic scheme emphasizes form 
over color, characteristic of analytical Cubism's exploration of multiple perspectives and the fourth dimension 
of time compressed into a single image.""",
    
    "Art Deco": """A glamorous architectural interior featuring bold geometric patterns, luxurious materials, and 
streamlined forms characteristic of 1920s modernism. The space showcases a sweeping staircase with chrome railings 
in zigzag motifs, flanked by black and gold lacquered panels inlaid with stylized sunburst designs. The floor 
displays an elaborate terrazzo pattern of concentric circles and chevrons in onyx, ivory, and jade green. Soaring 
vertical columns are adorned with stylized flora and fauna in bronze relief. A massive chandelier dominates the 
ceiling—a cascade of frosted glass arranged in tiered geometric forms. The color palette combines rich jewel 
tones—emerald, sapphire, and ruby red—with metallic gold and silver accents. Every surface celebrates symmetry, 
streamlining, and ornamentation, from the Egyptian-inspired hieroglyphic borders to the machine-age precision 
of chrome fixtures. The aesthetic exudes opulence, optimism, and the machine-age elegance that defined the 
Jazz Age's embrace of modernity and luxury.""",
